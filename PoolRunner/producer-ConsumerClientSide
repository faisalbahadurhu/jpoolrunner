Each performance metric is shown in a separate graphic panel where its Dataupdater object continously update the 
grahps on arrival of responses . Response and wait panels have sepate Histograms graphs for each request type. whereas
 Poolsize and wait panels shows only averages. All performance metrics panels extends Consumer object in order to
 consume fetch responses from a producer-consumer queue and plot the desired results. consumer object implements
  a MessageListener interface and listens for a message when arrives from the server and put the message in a 
  produceconsumer queue. Since each panel extends consumer so each panel has its own queue. When Receiver objects receivs a
  message from the server it hand it over to Producer object that have list of all MessageListeners. Producer produce the 
  response to all MessageListenr objects by putting the response in each producer-consumer queue.
