The requests send by the client to the server are simulated throurgh Runnable objects. CpuBoundTask and IOBoundTask
 are two classes that are Runnable and extends Task class that is also Serializable so that it can be sent over a 
 network. An IOBoundTask object simulates an I/O bound job whereas CPUBoundTask object  simulates a CPU bound job.
 Both of these objects are run by the Thread Pool System. Task object provides set of methods that are used to
 mark time stamps on the request. The parameters of Task object are used to measure the server performance.
